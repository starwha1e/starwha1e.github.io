<p>Splatoon 2 is a third-person shooter developed by Nintendo, the sequel of Splatoon, whose gameplay ideas distinguishes it from other titles in the genre (Robinson, 2014). Players use a controller to play this game and can use motion sensing to support aiming by leaning the controller.</p>
<p><strong>A broad analysis of  Splatoon 2</strong></p>
<p>Splatoon 2 uses coloured ink ammunition instead of real ammunition. This subverts the rules and game experience of a traditional shooting game to a certain extent. Shooting ink on the ground can set up a fast-moving path for the player and create obstacles for the enemy’s movement at the same time (the character will be slowed down significantly, and the heath point will decrease slightly if steps on enemy’s ink). Besides, during combat, the player can dive into the ink to refill ink ammunition and restore health points. This can also reduce the chance of the character being hit. Shooting ink on the wall will allow the player to climb on the wall, even hiding on there. The ink ammunition in Splatoon 2 is the core idea. The game has a whole set of self-contained gameplay mechanisms around this idea.</p>
<p>The core mechanisms, which is the single play experience the game designer is trying to convey (Brathwaite &amp; Schreiber, 2009) of Splatoon 2, like many other third-person shooter, is shooting. This core mechanism is closely associated with other mechanisms and the goal of the game (Figure 1). The using of motion sensing is an intuitive method for player to move or aim.

<p>Splatoon 2 has several game modes, in the Turf War mode, which is the fundamental mode of the game, players are divided into teams of four, and the object is navigating the map, cover more turf of the map with ink than the opponents in three minutes. Other game modes will be unlocked when the player reaches a certain level in the game.</p>
<p>This essay will focus on the game design and player experience in Turf War mode. A player is invited to play this game for 20 minutes, five rounds in total. This player has played Splatoon 2 for more than 100 hours, and have a greater understanding of this game than the average player. Two gameplay vignettes, which are typical scenes in this game when playing online with other players will be illustrated and analysed.</p>

<p>The map has a main road and two alleys on the sides (Figure 2).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200314_132422.jpg" alt="Figure 2">
The game has just started, players are spawned at their spawn points. Our player first quickly checks the map and paint the ground with his teammates alternately towards the main road. Two teammates dive into the ink painted by the player and spray ink forward to the centre of the map. The player then dives into the ink painted by a teammate, and quickly swim to the centre of the map (Figure 3).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_210011.png" alt="Figure 3">
There is no enemy appears near the centre of the map, two teammates stay at the centre of the map and paint the ground. Our player and one teammate paint the ground of the alley on the left, then they quickly swim to a place near enemy’s spawn point, peaking at the area outside the base and found an enemy heading forward (Figure 4, centre).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/vignette1/20200310_205843.png" alt="Figure 4">
Our player then overtakes the teammate, sneaks behind that enemy, and before the enemy noticing, the player shoots and kills the enemy (Figure 5). After this manoeuvre, the player is on the main road, near the centre of the map, back to the enemy’s spawn point. Then the player finds there is an enemy spraying ink with bombs from the other alley (Figure 5, left).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200318_172008.png" alt="Figure 5">
The player then goes back to the alley covered with his ink, turn over, facing the alley where the enemy was shooting and hide. That enemy does not push forward, and the player chooses to swim back quickly to the previous position, oriented at the spawn point of enemy’s, and hides in ink on the slope. Then the enemy ‘respawned’ appears in the player’s sight (Figure 6).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_210728.png" alt="Figure 6">
Our player jumps out of the ink and start shooting, the enemy shoots back after a small time interval, does some damage to the player but got killed first.</p>
<p>These actions are taken place in the first 40 seconds of the game, showing the essential feature of Splatoon 2 — Ink.</p>
<p><em>Understanding and Controlling the Ink environment</em>
The essence of the game is all about ink. The ink in this game not only allows players to sneak into and move quickly but also enables players to climb to heights to get a better view, restore the ink ammunition and health point, slow down and expose enemies—the investigation, pushing forward and retreating depends on ink significantly.</p>
<p>The player’s understanding of the ink environment is shown in the vignette. In the first 30 seconds of the game, the player has made many choices. To understand these choices, the micro and macro choices will be analysed separately. The micro choices are the small, transitory choices the player made in the game while the macro choices are for the general situation and are composed of many micro-choices (Salen &amp; Zimmerman, 2004).
Two typical micro choices in the early game in Splatoon 2 are painting the ground (and get points for the special weapon) and diving into the existing ink (to quickly move to a specific place), and there are instant feedbacks for these two micro choices in the game. In addition to leaving ink on the floor or move quickly to a position, the tank on the top right corner of the screen will cumulate points for a powerful special weapon when the player paints the ground.
Besides, diving into the existing ink to quickly move to a specific place or painting the ground is associated with the player’s macro choice - rush to a position that enemies would not expect and try to kill an enemy. The micro choices here are linked to clear consequences.</p>
<p>As for the macro choices, the nature of the map in this game will be illustrated first: roughly both teams will have a third of the map uncontested, which allows players to have a secure section to mark their territory (Figure 7, A and C). Leaving only the centre of the map (Figure 7, B) to be the contest zone and the deciding factor on which team will win or lose , meaning the control of this section is the utmost importance.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200312_150104.jpg" alt="Figure 7">
The internal structure of micro and macro choices in Splatoon 2 is that, the micro choices which constitute macro choices will provide immediate feedback. The player will have a sense that the choices he made are meaningful during the game.</p>
<p>There are two main strategies in the turf war mode. One is trying to avoid encounter enemies and try to paint as many grounds as possible. This is directly linked to the condition of winning. The points of special weapons and the ink on ground provide immediate feedback, and in the settlement after one game, how many times the special weapon is used will be shown, which provides a sense of accomplishment for the player. Another strategy is painting the ground while finding and trying to enemies at the same time. In Splatoon 2, killing enemies has not become insignificant. The combat phase involves more choices, which will be illustrated in the following vignette.</p>
<h3 id="vignette-2-combat-phase-in-game">Vignette 2, combat phase in game<a href="#vignette-2-combat-phase-in-game" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>An enemy has pushed to the alley near the player’s spawn point, and the path is covered by the enemy’s ink. Our player is heading from the base, reaches a high ground, and inspects the situation (Figure 8).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_211349.png" alt="Figure 8">
The enemy does not push forward, our player jumps from the high ground and hides against a wall, inspects the situation (Figure 9).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_211240.png" alt="Figure 9">
When the enemy retreats, the player quickly paint a path to the end of the alley. There is a short wall separate the entrance to this alley from the main road. The player paints the wall and leaves the top of it still covered by the enemy’s ink. Then the player jumps over the wall, facing the main road (Figure 10, middle).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200312_124853.png" alt="Figure 10">
Then, the player finds that retreating enemy on the main around, who makes a splash in ink in front of a box (Figure 11).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_211741.png" alt="Figure 11">
Our player pushes forward and kills the enemy. As the player pushes forward, another enemy can be seen down the end of the main road near the enemy’s spawn point (Figure 12).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_212616.png" alt="Figure 12">
The player quickly paints the ground and move to a position behind a bunker. At this time, the player runs out of ink. Then the player uses the ink on the floor retreating to a safe place (Figure 13).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200310_212722.png" alt="Figure 13">
This combat phase is taken place in less than ten seconds, and this is a typical length of combat in Splatoon 2.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of the combat</strong>
The macro choice the player made here is to kill an enemy, which can not only ease the pressure of teammates but also prevent that enemy from painting turf. On the other hand, if the player does not get a kill, a certain amount of area can be taken over, some enemies may get back and recover the ground, which also ease the pressure of the teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-combat decisions</strong>
The time between shooting and killing the enemy or getting killed is really short, which means the decisions made before the combat are crucial. Those decisions including moving, restraining enemy using ink or suppressing. The purpose of these actions is to put the player in a favourable situation or to put the opponent into a disadvantaged situation.</p>
<p>Before rushing to an enemy and start shooting, the player will make several micro choices: spraying ink on the ground to allow a wider range of moving or directly shooting the enemy. The first choice is safer and allow the player to have more operating space and restrains the enemy at the same time, but it also gives enemies more time to react — fight back or retreat. If the player chooses directly shoot the enemy and cannot kill him immediately, there will be limited choice for the player afterwards.</p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, if the player successfully kills the enemy , the enemy will explode and a certain amount ink of the player’s colour will cover the ground, helping the player to take control of that territory and that enemy will not appear on the map for a short period. In the worst-case scenario, if the enemy retreats or the player gets killed, these micro choices also have positive effects. If the player chooses to spray ink on the ground and the enemy chooses to retreat, the player will easily occupy that turf and gain points for the special weapon. If the player’s shot is completely missing and even gets killed, the ink bullets on the ground can still successfully prevents the opponent from moving, and provide teammates with an opportunity to sneak in.</p>
<p>The micro choices in combat phase provide immediate feedback, no matter an attack is successful or not, the player will have a sense of contribution to the bigger picture. Besides, there is no health bar in this game, if the player is shot, there will be enemy’s ink on the UI of the player, and this can instantly help the player to adjust their micro choices, making the choices flexible and meaningful.</p>
<p>In the vignette above, the player painted a secret path to the main road, attacked, leaving little time for the enemy to react, and finally retreat successfully. The micro choices in this whole process all gives clear and immediate feedback, shows the crucial design pattern of Splatoon 2—providing feedback for every micro choices and making the choices of the player meaningful.</p>
<p>The meaningful choices in the game, as well as other design patterns, constitute a great player experience, which will be further analysed in the following segment.</p>
<h2 id="play-experience">Play experience<a href="#play-experience" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>As it is shown in the game experience questionnaire filled by our player (Appendix 1), the category of flow gets the highest mark and competence gets the second-highest mark. Flow is an experience “so gratifying that people are willing to do it for its own sake, with little concern for what they will get out of it, even when it is difficult or dangerous” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).</p>
<p>According to the eight elements of flow experience by Sweetser &amp; Wyeth (2005), Splatoon 2 provide a great flow experience especially through these aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clear goals and immediate feedback
In turf war mode, the goal is to cover more turf with ink than opponents, the map which shows the current situation can be checked immediately. Players can easily to find where to go next (Figure 14), which set goals for them on a subconscious level.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200311_155502.jpg" alt="Figure 14">
As it is illustrated in the two vignettes above, while the player shooting at the ground, the ground will be covered with the player&rsquo;s ink and the player will earn points for the special weapon(Figure 15, top right corner). When the enemy&rsquo;s ink hits the player, there will be ink covers the screen instead of showing a health bar. When an enemy is shot, the player&rsquo;s ink will cover the enemy&rsquo;s body.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200311_154308.png" alt="Figure 15">
These methods provide immediate feedback for player&rsquo;s micro choice in the game. The use of ink to represent health point shows the internal structure of the gameplay ideas surrounding ink and provide immersion at the same time, which make it possible for players to enter the flow state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A perceived sense of control over actions, lack of a sense of worry about losing control
The clear and easy-to-recognise ink area in Splatoon 2 constructs the psychological safety zone and the danger zone in the combat, providing the player with a sense of control when making decisions and minimising the negative feedback brought by killed by an enemy from nowhere. In order to reduce such negative feedback, Splatoon&rsquo;s combat distance is very well controlled. All kinds of weapons are all within the player&rsquo;s line of sight, even the sniper with the longest range will be pointed out by a &lsquo;laser&rsquo; when it is aiming.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictuslh/Image_Hosting/master/uPic/20200311_154706.jpg" alt="Figure 16">
The safety zone and danger zone constructed by ink allow the player to find out the current situation quickly without worry about losing control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A challenging, rule-bound activity that requires skills
The one simple rule — the player can swim faster in their ink, and the opponent will be slow down significantly establishes different challenges for new players and experienced players. As it is illustrated above, the control of weapon range limits the space of combats, and this makes the game easier for staters (The player can easily see where the enemy is, and it is easier to shoot an enemy when the distance is short). However, the ink also provides a certain amount of space complexity by increasing the speed when the player is swimming in ink. The time used to get to a specific point is different depending on the variety of ink environment, which provides different types of strategies for experienced players to explore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ability to concentrate on the task at hand
The player can check the status of the map easily, which make it possible to quickly decide which part of the map to go, at a specific position on the map, the player can easily concentrate on painting the ground, cumulating points for special weapons or trying to attack an enemy. Furthermore, these small objects have an inner relationship with each other, special weapons can help the player to kill enemies and paint ground easily, and paint ground will also prove points to charge the special weapons, this process makes new tasks emergence continuously, and the player will constantly be concentrating and enter the flow state.</p>
